# ApexObj

Provides a cached instance of an object providing information on map rotation timings for Apex Legends via properties, computed properties, and methods.

## Beta information

ApexObj is a nodejs module which provides data about the game Apex Legends by Respawn Entertainment. It was spun off from a Discord bot when the functionality grew enough to warrant it. The Discord bot is also being rewritten from the ground up, and this project is under active development alongside it.

Full documentation is a target of the v.1.0.0 release. There may be frequent breaking changes before the project reaches the v1 milestone.

## Basic usage

Install via NPM

```sh
npm install --save ApexObj
```

Use as a nodejs module

```js
const Apex = require('ApexObj')
```
